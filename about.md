### About me

My name is Sebastian Scheckel, I'm a masters student of Applied Geographics and 
work as a freelancer in Innsbruck. Professionally, I am especially interested in
 data and spatial sciences. In my freetime I love swiming, biking, and reading. 


### About this blog

This blog presents some projects I worked on during my studies of Applied Geoinformatics. In addition, I also present some tutorial for the usage of Python in the context of data and spatial sciences. In the near future, I also plan to create some tutorials for JS, but also in the same context. Feel free to contact me. I am pleased about any suggestions for improvement (language as well thematically).
